# RUTGERS - Credit Card Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis
For this challenge, we have been asked to create a machine learning model to help determine credit card risk. While using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub and the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, we will:

  1. Build and evaluate models using resampling.
  2. Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE alrogithms and undersample using the ClusterCentroids algorithms.
  3. Use a combinatorial approach using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
  4. Compare the machine learning models that reduce bias and predict credit risk.

## Result
### Naive Random Oversampling
  > Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.6471540342692306
  > High/Low Precision: 0.01 (1%) and 1.00 (100%)
  > High/Low Recall: 0.62 (62%) and 0.67 (67%)
